# Project Description
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a given location. Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather.However, not all of these predictions prove to be reliable.

Here, this system will predict weather based on parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind. The user will enter the current temperature, humidity, and wind. The system will take these parameters and predict weather (rainfall in inches) from previous data in the database (dataset). The role of the admin is to add previous weather data to the database, so that the system will calculate weather (estimated rainfall in inches) based on this data. The weather forecasting system takes parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind and forecasts weather based on previous records. This prediction will prove reliable. This system can be used in air traffic, marine, agriculture, forestry, military, and navy operations, etc.

I have developed using Azure Machine Learning Classic.
